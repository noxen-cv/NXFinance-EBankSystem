### 2. admin.js
- Removed hardcoded sample loan and card data
- Added API fetch functions to load dashboard data
- Implemented error handling for failed API requests
- Added functions to update the UI with dynamic data

### 3. admin-info.html
- Removed hardcoded admin profile information
- Added loading placeholders for all dynamic content
- Preserved image upload functionality with localStorage fallback
- Added ID attributes for JavaScript targeting

### 4. admin-info.js

## API Integration Points

### Dashboard API Endpoint
- URL: `/api/admin/dashboard`
- Method: GET
- Authentication: Bearer token
- Response: Dashboard statistics, approved loans, pending loans

### Admin Profile API Endpoint
- URL: `/api/admin/profile`
- Method: GET
- Authentication: Bearer token
- Response: Admin profile details including name, contact info, etc.

### Loan History API Endpoint
- URL: `/api/admin/loans`
- Method: GET
- Authentication: Bearer token
- Response: Loan summary statistics and detailed loan history

## Next Steps

1. **API Implementation**
   - Complete the backend API endpoints to match the frontend expectations
   - Add proper response validation and error handling
   - Implement authentication middleware for all admin routes

2. **Data Validation**
   - Add client-side validation for all forms
   - Implement proper error handling for failed API requests
   - Show appropriate loading states during data fetching

3. **Testing**
   - Test the interface with sample API responses
   - Verify all dynamic elements update correctly
   - Test error handling and edge cases

4. **UI Enhancement**
   - Add loading indicators during API calls
   - Improve error messaging for users
   - Implement real-time data updates where appropriate

## Security Considerations
- All API requests now use authentication headers
- Client-side data is sanitized before display
- Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- Local storage only used for non-sensitive user preferences

## Future Improvements
- Add WebSockets for real-time updates on the dashboard
- Implement client-side caching for better performance
- Add offline support for basic functionality
- Enhance filtering and sorting capabilities
