## Additional Notes

- These accounts are automatically created during system initialization.
- The system uses email-based authentication (not username-based).
- All passwords are securely hashed in the database using bcrypt.
- For security reasons, please change these default passwords in production.
- JWT tokens expire after 24 hours and will require re-authentication.

## Database Schema

The authentication system uses three related tables:
1. **users** - Contains core authentication data (email, password, role)
2. **customers** - Contains customer profile data linked to user accounts
3. **admins** - Contains admin profile data linked to user accounts

The email field is synchronized between these tables to ensure consistency.
