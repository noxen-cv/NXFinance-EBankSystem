## Security Features Implemented

1. **JWT Authentication**
   - Secure token-based authentication
   - Expiration handling
   - Role information embedded in tokens

2. **Request Validation**
   - Input validation for all API endpoints
   - Protection against invalid or malicious inputs

3. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Separation of customer and admin privileges
   - Middleware for role verification

4. **Data Protection**
   - Password hashing with bcrypt
   - Database query parameterization to prevent SQL injection

## Frontend Integration Points

The backend has been implemented with clear API endpoints that will allow the frontend to:

1. **Customer Dashboard**
   - Retrieve account balances and details
   - Get transaction history
   - Display card information
   - Show loan status and payment details

2. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Access system-wide statistics
   - Manage customer accounts
   - Review and approve loan applications
   - Monitor transaction activity

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Integration**
   - Connect the clientSide dashboard to the API endpoints
   - Implement the adminSide interface with the admin API endpoints

2. **Testing**
   - Unit testing for all model functions
   - Integration testing for API endpoints
   - End-to-end testing with frontend

3. **Deployment**
