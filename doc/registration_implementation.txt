## NXFinance Registration Page Implementation

This implementation adds a smooth transition from the login page to a registration page when the "Register Now" button is clicked.

### Files Created:

1. `public/register.html` - The HTML structure for the registration page
2. `src/register.css` - Styling for the registration page
3. `src/register.js` - JavaScript functionality for the registration page

### Files Modified:

1. `public/login.html` - Updated the "Register Now" button to transition to the registration page

### Features:

1. Smooth Transition: 
   - Fade-out effect when transitioning between pages
   - Slide-in animations for panels

2. Registration Form:
   - Name, Email, and Password fields
   - Toggle password visibility
   - Form validation and error handling
   - Loading overlay for API calls

3. Interactive Elements:
   - Hoverable credit card image
   - Back button to return to the login page
   - Responsive design for various screen sizes

4. Layout:
   - Left panel: Registration form with white background
   - Right panel: NX Finance branding, card image, and welcome text with dark background

### How It Works:

1. When a user clicks "Register Now" on the login page, the page fades out and transitions to the registration page
2. The registration form validates user input and sends it to the server API
3. Upon successful registration, the user is redirected back to the login page
4. The interface is intuitive with clear instructions and visual feedback

This implementation follows modern web design practices with smooth transitions and a user-friendly interface.
